          <div class="para">
        Walter Elias Disney(December 5, 1901–December 15, 1966) was an American 
        animator, film producer and entrepreneur. A pioneer of the American animation 
        industry, he introduced several developments in the production of cartoons.
        He took art classes as a boy and got a job as a commercial illustrator at the 
        age of 18. He moved to California in the early 1920s and set up the Disney 
        Brothers Studio with his brother Roy. Disney was a shy, self-deprecating and 
        insecure man in private but adopted a warm and outgoing public persona. 
        He had high standards and high expectations of those with whom he worked.

        <div class="head"> ●Early life</div>
        <div class="para">
        Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 1249 Tripp Avenue, in Chicago's 
        Hermosa neighborhood.[a] He was the fourth son of Elias Disney‍—‌born in the 
        Province of Canada, to Irish parents‍—‌and Flora , an American of German and
        English descent. Disney developed his interest in drawing when he was paid to
        draw the horse of a retired neighborhood doctor. 
        Elias was a subscriber to the Appeal to Reason newspaper, and Disney
        practiced drawing by copying the front-page cartoons of Ryan Walker. He also 
        began to develop an ability to work with watercolors and crayons.Disney 
        and his brother Roy woke up at 4:30 every morning to deliver the Times before 
        school and repeated the round for the evening Star after school. The schedule 
        was exhausting, and Disney often received poor grades after falling asleep in 
        class, but he continued his paper route for more than six years.

        <div class="head">  ●Personal life and character</div>
        <div class="para">
        Early in 1925, Disney hired an ink artist, Lillian Bounds. 
        They married in July of that year, at her brother's house in her hometown of 
        Lewiston, Idaho. The marriage was generally happy, according to Lillian,
        although according to Disney's biographer Neal Gabler she did not "accept Walt's 
        decisions meekly or his status unquestionably, and she admitted that he was always
        telling people 'how henpecked he is'. Disney's public persona was very different 
        from his actual personality. Playwright Robert E.

        <div class="head">●Career</div>
        <div class="para">
        <div class="career">..Early career: 1920–1928</div>
        In January 1920, as Pesmen-Rubin's revenue declined after Christmas, Disney, 
        aged 18, and Iwerks were laid off. They started their own business, the short-lived
        Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists. Failing to attract many customers, Disney and 
        Iwerks agreed that Disney should leave temporarily to earn money at the Kansas 
        City Film Ad Company. Disney became interested in animation, although he 
        preferred drawn cartoons such as Mutt and Jeff and Max Fleischer's Out of the 
        Inkwell. Disney moved to Hollywood in July 1923 at 21 years old. In February 1928, 
        Disney hoped to negotiate 
        a larger fee for producing the Oswald series, but found Mintz wanting to 
        reduce the payments.

        <div class="career">..Creation of Mickey Mouse to the first Academy Awards: 1928 -1933</div>

        To replace Oswald, Disney and Iwerks developed Mickey Mouse, possibly 
        inspired by a pet mouse that Disney had adopted while working in his Laugh-O-Gram 
        studio, although the origins of the character are unclear. Disney's original 
        choice of name was Mortimer Mouse, but his wife Lillian thought it too pompous,
        and suggested Mickey instead. Iwerks revised Disney's provisional sketches to 
        make the character easier to animate. Disney, who had begun to distance himself 
        from the animation process, provided Mickey's voice until 1947.

        <div class="career">....Golden age of animation: 1934–1941</div>

        By 1934, Disney had become dissatisfied with producing formulaic cartoon shorts,
        and believed a feature-length cartoon would be more profitable. The studio began
        the four-year production of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, based on the fairy 
        tale. When news leaked out about the project, many in the film industry predicted 
        it would bankrupt the company; industry insiders nicknamed it "Disney's Folly".
        The film, which was the first animated feature made in full color and sound, 
        cost $1.5 million to produce‍—‌three times over budget. Disney's animators developed
        a multiplane camera which allowed drawings on pieces of glass to be set at 
        various distances from the camera, creating an illusion of depth. The first 
        work created on the camera‍—‌a Silly Symphony called The Old Mill (1937)‍—‌won the
        Academy Award for Animated Short Film because of its impressive visual power.
        Snow White premiered in December 1937 to high praise from critics and audiences.

        Disney continued to produce full-length animated features too, 
        including Alice in Wonderland (1951) and Peter Pan (1953). He provided four exhibits for the 1964 New 
        York World's Fair, for which he obtained funding from selected corporate sponsors.
        For PepsiCo, who planned a tribute to UNICEF, Disney developed It's a Small World,
        a boat ride with audio-animatronic dolls depicting children of the world; Great
        Moments with Mr. Lincoln contained an animatronic Abraham Lincoln giving excerpts
        from his speeches; Carousel of Progress promoted the importance of electricity; 
        and Ford's Magic Skyway portrayed the progress of mankind.
